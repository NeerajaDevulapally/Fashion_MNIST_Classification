# Fashion_MNIST_Classification
In this project, we have build a fashion recognition model using the convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
To train the model we use Fashion-MNIST dataset, a dataset of Zalandoâ€™s article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.
After successful training, the CNN model can able to predict the name of the class given apparel item belongs to.
This is a multi-class classification problem in which there are 10 apparel classes the items will be classified.
This MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images,associated with a label from 10 classes.
So, the end goal is to train and test the model using Convolutional Neural Network.
